## Date for the Grocery Rebate

On July 5, 2023, the Grocery Rebate payment will be issued alongside the GST/HST credit. No need to applyâ€”just make sure you've filed your 2021 tax return. The amount you receive is based on your family situation as of January 2023 and your 2021 income. You could get the Grocery Rebate even if you're not eligible for the July GST/HST.
