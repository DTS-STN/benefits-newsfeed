## Increase in Old Age Security (OAS) payment amount for those 75 and older

Starting July 2022, Old Age Security pensions will automatically increase by 10% for those who are or will be 75 by June 2022. If your 75th birthday is after July 1, 2022, you'll receive this increase in the month right after you turn 75. This increase won't affect your Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS).
