## New one-time grant for Allowance and Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) Benefits recipients

You could receive a special one-time taxable payment if your Allowance or GIS amount was reduced after receiving  the CERB or CRB (Canada Emergency Response Benefit or Canada Recovery Benefit). This payment equals the amount of benefits you lost starting from July 2021.
