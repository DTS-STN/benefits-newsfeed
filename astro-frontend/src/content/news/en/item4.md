## Sign-In Partner Caisse Alliance temporarily unavailable

Starting October 16, 2023, Caisse Alliance will no longer be used as a Sign-In Partner to access: 

- My Service Canada Account (MSCA)
- Canada Revenue Agency - My Account
- Canada Revenue Agency - My Business Account 
- National Student Loans Service Centre Account
- ROE Web
- Grants and Contributions Online Services (GCOS)

We expect that Caisse Alliance will be back as a Sign-In Partner in early 2024. Meanwhile, you can use an alternative Sign-In Partner or another sign-in method for your transactions.
